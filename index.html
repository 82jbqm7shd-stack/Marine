      <p>
        Hopking’s professional career developed from expedition and adventure-based maritime operations in the early 1990s into
        senior command and project leadership roles within the superyacht sector. His work has been documented through a combination
        of contemporaneous press reporting, broadcast documentaries, specialist industry publications, and regulatory records.

      <h2 id="early-career">Early expedition and adventure sailing</h2>

      <p>
        In the early 1990s, Hopking undertook expedition and adventure-based maritime work connected with John and Rebecca Ridgway.
        He participated in a sea-kayaking expedition around Cape Horn that was documented in contemporaneous press coverage and later
        media sources, including a 1993 ITV film and published narrative accounts of the expedition.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Separately, Hopking’s work at the Ridgway Adventure School in Sutherland, Scotland, formed the subject of a Channel 4
        <em>Cutting Edge</em> documentary episode concerned with management training and programme delivery at the school.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>

      <h2 id="antarctic">Antarctic operations</h2>
      <p>
        In 1999, Hopking served as captain of the yacht <em>2041</em>, acquired by environmentalist Robert Swan as part of an Antarctic
        Treaty awareness programme. In this role, he skippered the vessel from the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Peninsula, supporting
        expeditionary activity and public engagement around polar environmental protection.<sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup>

      <h2 id="superyacht-command">Superyacht command</h2>

      <p>
        From the early 2000s, Hopking’s career focused increasingly on large private motor yachts. Between 2011 and 2016, he commanded
        the 78-metre motor yacht <em>Hampshire II</em> and contributed to published industry discussion concerning regulatory pressures and
        change within the sector.<sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a><a href="#ref-10">[10]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        During this period, he received recognition through the Global Business Excellence Awards.<sup><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>

    <section aria-labelledby="project-leadership">
      <h2 id="project-leadership">New build and project leadership</h2>
      <p>
       Hopking later acted as build captain and project manager for the 74-metre Feadship explorer yacht <em>Sherpa</em>, overseeing construction
at Feadship’s Royal Van Lent shipyard. The build and launch attracted coverage in specialist yachting media, and Hopking featured in
documentary material relating to the project.<sup><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a><a href="#ref-15">[15]</a></sup>

      <p>
        Hopking holds a Master’s Certificate of Competency issued by the UK Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, which can be verified through the
        MCA’s online certificate validation service.<sup><a href="#ref-14">[14]</a></sup>
