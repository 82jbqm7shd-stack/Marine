      <p class="note">

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking’s professional career developed from expedition and adventure-based maritime operations in the early 1990s into
        senior command and project leadership roles within the superyacht sector. His work has been documented through a combination
        of contemporaneous press reporting, broadcast documentaries, specialist industry publications, and regulatory records.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Early expedition and adventure sailing</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1990s, Hopking was associated with expedition and adventure-based maritime activity connected with the
        John Ridgway Adventure School in Sutherland, Scotland. During this period he participated in a sea-kayaking expedition
        around Cape Horn, an undertaking documented in contemporaneous press coverage and later broadcast media.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expedition featured in a 1993 ITV documentary and in an episode of Channel 4’s <em>Cutting Edge</em> documentary strand,
        and was also described in published narrative accounts of the expedition.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Antarctic operations</h2>
      <p>
        In 1999, Hopking served as captain of the yacht <em>2041</em>, acquired by environmentalist Robert Swan as part of an Antarctic
        Treaty awareness programme. In this role, he skippered the vessel from the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Peninsula,
        supporting expeditionary activity and public engagement around polar environmental protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The voyage and associated expeditions were documented in published form, contributing to the public record of the programme.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Superyacht command</h2>
      <p>
        From the early 2000s, Hopking’s career focused increasingly on large private motor yachts. Between 2011 and 2016,
        he commanded the 78-metre motor yacht <em>Hampshire II</em>. During this period, he contributed to published discussion
        within the superyacht industry concerning regulatory change, professional standards, and operational practice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>New build and project leadership</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking later acted as build captain and project leader for the 74-metre Feadship explorer yacht <em>Sherpa</em>,
        overseeing construction at the Royal Van Lent shipyard. The build process attracted coverage in specialist yachting
        media and was followed in a documentary film that examined the design, construction, and operational intent of the vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recognition of associated professional practice and project delivery, Hopking received a Global Business Excellence Award.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Professional credentials</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking holds a Master’s Certificate of Competency issued by the UK Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, which can be verified
        through the MCA’s online certificate validation service. His professional standing is further reflected in published
        affiliations and industry recognition.
