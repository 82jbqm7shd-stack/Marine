      <div class="note">
        <em>
          This page distinguishes between information supported by published sources and material held in private records.
          Where evidence is unpublished or privately held, it is treated conservatively and not presented as independently verifiable.
        </em>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking’s career developed from expedition and adventure-based sailing in Scotland in the early 1990s into polar operations and senior command appointments
        in the superyacht sector, followed by new-build delivery and project leadership roles. Published coverage includes documentary material and specialist
        yachting press, as well as industry commentary attributed to Hopking in professional periodicals.<sup><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="early">
      <h2>Early expedition and adventure sailing</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking worked at the John Ridgway Adventure School (now Ridgway Adventure) in the Scottish Highlands in the early 1990s.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
        A Channel 4 documentary episode, <em>Exposure</em> (1993), is associated with the Ridgway Adventure School’s approach to experiential training and expedition preparation.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        During the same period, Hopking participated in a sea-kayaking expedition around Cape Horn with John and Rebecca Ridgway. The expedition was documented
        in later-accessible media sources including an ITV film upload and Rebecca Ridgway’s published memoir.<sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <em>
          The Channel 4 documentary and the Cape Horn expedition are treated here as distinct: the former concerns training activity at the Ridgway Adventure School,
          whereas the latter is described in published accounts as a Ridgway family expedition rather than a school programme.
        </em>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="polar">
      <h2>Antarctic operations</h2>
      <p>
        In 1999, Hopking became captain of the expedition yacht <em>2041</em>, acquired for environmental education and Antarctic Treaty awareness initiatives associated with polar explorer Robert Swan’s 2041 Foundation.<sup><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>
        A published expedition narrative, <em>2041: Voyage South</em>, documents the vessel’s objectives and operations in the Antarctic region.<sup><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="command">
      <h2>Superyacht command</h2>
      <p>
        In the superyacht sector, Hopking held senior command positions including the 78-metre motor yacht <em>Hampshire II</em> (reported in private records).<sup><a href="#ref-10">[10]</a></sup>
        During this period, Hopking received an “Outstanding Personal Achievement” award at the Global Business Excellence Awards, listed by the awards programme among previous winners.<sup><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopking is credited in <em>The Crew Report</em> (SuperyachtNews / The Superyacht Group) as a contributor to professional discussion of regulation and culture within the yachting sector,
        including a “Captains’ comments” feature in Issue 76 (2015) and a further “Captains’ comments” entry in Issue 77 (2016).<sup><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="governance">
      <h2>Senior command as strategic and governance leadership</h2>
      <p>
        The published record of Hopking’s roles in command, build delivery, and professional commentary supports treating his senior yachting work as encompassing
        governance-aligned responsibilities in a regulated, safety-critical environment. In organisational terms, such work typically includes oversight of compliance systems,
        operational risk management, stakeholder coordination (owners, shipyards, flag states, class, and insurers), and assurance of audit readiness and documentary control,
        alongside leadership of multi-disciplinary teams and contracted suppliers.<sup><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        While yachting command is not formally equivalent to land-based corporate directorship, the functional scope of responsibility—particularly in regulated, capital-intensive operations—can
        resemble non-executive governance objectives such as independent oversight, risk scrutiny, and performance assurance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="build">
      <h2>New build and project leadership</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking later served as build captain and project manager for the Feadship yacht <em>Sherpa</em>, a 74-metre support / explorer vessel launched in 2018 and covered in specialist yachting press.<sup><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup>
        A documentary-style film of the project is publicly available on YouTube.<sup><a href="#ref-14">[14]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="credentials">
      <h2>Professional credentials</h2>
      <p>
        Hopking holds UK-issued maritime certification. The UK Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency provides an online service for certificate verification of Certificates of Competency
        and Flag State Endorsements.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="media">
      <h2>Broadcast and documentary appearances</h2>
      <p>
        Published sources associate Hopking with documentary material spanning expedition activity and superyacht build coverage.
